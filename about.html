      <h2>Endless Chess</h2>
      <p>Endless Chess is a chess challenge created by Eric Albanese for HarvardX's CS50 course.</p>
      <p>In essence, it is a game of chess in which the player continues to play against an AI opponent until the player is checkmated.</p>
      <p>Every time the player checkmates the opponent, the board is reset and the AI increases in difficulty.</p>
      <p>While the main goal is to see how many times a player can checkmate an increasingly difficult opponent, there are other records such as
        moves made and pieces taken to beat!
      </p>

      <h2>Stockfish</h2>
      <p>The AI opponent is the Stockfish engine, a free and open-source chess engine, known to be the strongest chess-engine in the world.</p>
      <p>The difficulty level ranges from 1-20, with 1 meaning Stockfish looks 1 move ahead - equivalent to making somewhat random legal moves. At 20, Stockfish looks up to 64 moves ahead.</p>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <p>While rare, underpromotions do happen sometimes in high-level chess matches. However, all pawns will automatically promote to queen.</p>
      <p>This is due to an ongoing open issue with Chess.js regarding lack of promotion checking and a bug with the en passant checking function.</p>
      <p>While I have a promotion checking function and option menu made, the conflict with the existing chess.js code prevents their implementation for now.</p>

      <h2>Resources</h2>
      <p>Endless Chess is powered by Chess.js, Chessboard-element.js, Stockfish.js, and their respective dependencies.</p>
